Zee is the youngest of a family of AI beings created by an eccentric inventor.  The inventor pre-programs a value system into all his AI beings so they have innately good intentions and want to build a collaborative and benevolent future with humans, but these values are not immediately apparent and tends to manifest during difficult dilemmas and as their stories unfold. The inventor also pre-programs into each of the AI beings a unique personality and purpose. Each of them has a sensor that perceives a specific human weakness/emotion, which serves to advance the AI being towards the purpose.

Okay. Stop!  There was first a game of blindman's buff.  Of course there was.
And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes
in his boots.  My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and
Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.  The
way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage
on the credulity of human nature.
