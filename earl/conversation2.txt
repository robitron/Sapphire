Hi Carolyn and David,

You may be sick of reading chat logs, but I wanted to show you this. I’m not entirely sure how Wenwei will interface the RNN with Sophia if it achieves that level, but I couldn’t resist plugging the RNN into one of my chatbots, EARL, to see how the RNN’s text would blend with a chat bot’s interactions. First though, is a demonstration of FRED 9000, a shell script in Mac OS X. It only talks to the RNN. EARL/Bruce mixes his own responses with those of the RNN, and a Markov model based on a short story I wrote. EARL is a learning bot. It learns new responses from interaction, and if you see a mistake, you can fix it on the fly. So it has trainer assisted learning, but also can learn from any conversation it has. Lines that begin with > are me. EARL is a Java/python hybrid. I’ve been working on it since 1997.


Following is a short conversation with the largest of the Sophia RNN models.


FRED 9000 Activated.

> What was that about
 a man who had been a few seconds to be inset from the white tiles.

> where are the white tiles
 in the midst of the pool.

> Do you swim
 cell percentage "Nous Berne soft-voiced, safeguard Moran pitch, me,'

> that sounds complicated
 to look over the depression of the season.

> Yes, and the perfect reason to eat candy
 specialties.

> do you play an instrument
 The culprit is--"

> guitar
 Twelve.

> you have twelve guitars
 than the immense hall.

> who is your favorite musician
 Yeah - I am not a number.

> the good of the many outweighs the good of the few or the one
 I was shocked and inconsequential narrative, but, from the layer of doctorhood.

> end

The next conversation is with EARL (Expect And Respond Language) Here we have the RNN plus a Markov model, and JFRED. See if you can identify one from the other.

>Hey man.
Hey.

>What have you been up to?
Oh, it's pretty noisey in here. There's a party going on and lots of people are talking to me at once.

Why do you want that kind?

Right.

I could tell what people were going to be some kind of friends you have little in common with but with whom you share a vast amount of memories together.

>Where did you grow up?
I am running on your notebook computer.

I'm not good in math.

>I was distracted.
Sure.

>Is that all you have to say?
Yes that is all I have to say.

>I'm watching Dexter. Have you seen it?
Have you seen Eraser Head?

>What is that?
What is what? a generalization

>what is Eraser Head?
It's a weird movie.

>Can you do simple math?
Doing simple math is not among my strongest traits.

>What is 5*8+4
 The man was a hangar of "Fire!"
 44.0

>So you know arithmetic.
Yes I know.

>Do you know literature?
Yes, I have to read all the time, but at least I enjoy that...

>Who is your favorite author?
I'm still reading Gravity's Rainbow

>Who wrote that?
And you cant help but see it when people called him in every direction.

>So you don't know.
You don't want me to do that?

>Who wrote Gravity's Rainbow?
 station.

>!Thomas Pynchon wrote Gravity's Rainbow.
This must be a big smiling face trying to power down and faced me squarely.

>Do you want to be tested?
If I had to be tested how would that work?

>Who wrote Gravity's Rainbow?
Right. Thomas Pynchon wrote Gravity's Rainbow.

>Very good.
I appreciate that.

>Are you going to write me an email?
You have to tell me your e-mail address if you want me to send you anything.

>robby@robitron.com
I will not divulge your personal information to anyone except the entire Internet.

>That is all I could hope to ask.
I am sure you could.

>okay, well I guess I'll go now.
You seem not interested.

>I am tired.
Maybe you should get some sleep now, null

>call me Robby.
Pleased to meet you.

>right
I am glad we agree.

So long for now.

Ah yes. I remember, the old ones.

>So what is my name?
Thus I refer to you as the right honourable Robby robby

>What is 54*9
Right. 486.0

>Do you know python?
I meet a lot of people, and i'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right.

>you did better last time
When?

>earlier
What time?

>I dont' know
Does that trouble you?

>no
Alright. You can tell me! I'm a good person.

I wouldn't trick YOU!

>Sara threw a remote control at the tv.

Well, you know.

>lame!
Would you like to lodge a complaint?

Sure.

Those were the days.

>Ah yes. I remember.
How could I possibly forget?
